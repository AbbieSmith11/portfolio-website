        I'm driven by the desire to make a difference. I enjoy working on
        projects that bring together problem-solving and helping others,
        creating solutions that feel meaningful as well as practical. With a
        passion for purposeful work and a mindset for continuous learning, I
        approach each project with curiosity, precision, and creativity.
